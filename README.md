Project Title: Module 15 Assignment - leaflet-challenge

Description: This script runs through a set of earthquake data, reads it, and maps the data based on various information (like coordinates and size).

File Structure: The JavaScript file contains the script that should be run. The script references a URL with earthquake data in a JSON format.

Code Source: I utilized a tutoring session for this assignment, and the tutor assisted me in structuring the functions that are run through. I referenced the 15-Mapping/2/02-Evr_HydrantsHeatmap activity to understand how to pull data from the url.

Author: Myself, Madeline Rondino.
